# Persona Identity client

In order to register on Persona and create a Persona ID a non-authenticated user should complete a form with two fields: Username and E-mail (both mandatory). After submitting the registration form, an e-mail with a link that will redirect the user to set his/her password will be sent to the address provided. 

Once the account is set, userâ€™s balance is topped up with the amount of Persona tokens (PRSN) needed to add the minimum attributes in order to have a Persona identity. These tokens are financed from the Enrollment Address, set up to support the creation of new users since everything on the blockchain requires a fee.

After registration, Persona User is able to add the minimum attributes to his/her Persona Identity: First Name, Last Name, Alias, SSN, DOB, Address/Residence, Email, Phone Number, Mother's Name, Father's Name, Birthplace as well as to upload a document (image/pdf format) and set the expiration date for it. Each time an attribute is added, user is required to enter his/her passphrase so the create attribute transaction is created.
